# Conducting independent addiction neuroimaging and psychophysiological studies

The Clinical Neuroimaging Research Core (CNIRC) lies within Building 10 of the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda Maryland. The Core focuses investigations on the neural correlates of cognition, emotions, decision making, motivation, impulsive and compulsive behaviors, and their association with alcohol use disorder. Utilizing imaging phenotypes to establish efficacy of experimental treatments and therapies along with imaging biomarkers to determine treatment choice and predict treatment outcome and relapse.

Maintaining a strong focus on structural and functional brain imaging working, the unit works closely with neurogenetics and molecular physiology labs to paint a fuller picture of the brain and body in addiction.  My role has centered on the screening, neuropsychological testing and coordination of behavioral/imaging tasks in treatment-seeking inpatients and healthy volunteers along with data management and preprocessing.

# Working Memory, how does it work?

"Working memory refers to the retention of information in conscious awareness when this information is not present in the environment, to its manipulation, and to its use in guiding behavior. Working memory has been implicated as a critical contributor to such essential cognitive functions and properties as language comprehension, learning, planning, reasoning, and general fluid intelligence" [Postle 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1428794/). 
	

# TILS, & AX-CPT

Collaborative project between the Gonzalez-Lima & Lewis-Peacock Labs searching to build off previous work in the areas of cognitive control and neurostimulation. 


> "When an archer is shooting for nothing, he has all his skill. If he shoots for a brass buckle, he is already nervous. If he shoots for a prize of gold, he goes blind or sees two targets He is out of his mind His skill has not changed. But the prize divides him. He cares. He thinks more of winning than of shooting And the need to win drains him of power" -Zhuang Zhou

             Working Memory as an Emergent Property of the Mind & Brain
   * [Lewis-Peacock et al 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222712/) <br/>
            Memory can be preserved across a brief delay despite the apparent loss of sustained representations. Delay-period activity               may in fact reflect the focus of attention, rather than short-term memory.

Video embeds are responsive and scale with the width of the main content block with the help of [FitVids](http://fitvidsjs.com/).

Not sure if this only effects Kramdown or if it's an issue with Markdown in general. But adding YouTube video embeds causes errors when building your Jekyll site. To fix add a space between the `<iframe>` tags and remove `allowfullscreen`. Example below:

{% highlight html %}
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SU3kYxJmWuQ" frameborder="0"> </iframe>

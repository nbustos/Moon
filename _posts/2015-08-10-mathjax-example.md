Housed in the Medical University of South Carolina within the Dept. of Neuroscience lives the Brain Cognition and Development Lab. 
The lab is focused on implementing multimodal imaging to illuminate neural mechanisms of cognition across populations and disease states. 

Currently the central focus of the lab is utilizing connectome predictive modeling to track the progression of brain aging in Alzheimers's Disease. 
In collaboraion with Drs. Joseph Helpern, Jens Jensen and Andreanna Benitez we are working on combining large dimensional datasets from MRI (resting-state, task), dMRI( DTI,
DKI, FBI), with clinical measures such as cognitive assesments (MoCA, MMSE) to better understand disease progression (from white matter deterioration indices) and to provide more accurate diagnoses of decline in mental functions (information and graph theoretic indices across regions of interest).
